# CarND-Behavioral-Cloning

In this project we aim to train a car on how to drive on the road autonomously. We train the model to predict the car steering angle using the dashboard camera output. To do so we use behaviour cloning. We collect the training data by driving the car using audacity's simulator. Once we have the required training data, we train the model using keras and then we test our model using the autonomous mode of the simulator.
